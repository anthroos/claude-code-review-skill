## What We're Looking For

- New review checks/rules
- Language-specific check improvements
- False positive reduction
- Documentation improvements
- Bug fixes

## Code Style

This repo is primarily Markdown. Please follow these guidelines:

- Use consistent heading levels (`#`, `##`, `###`) — do not skip levels
- Use ATX-style headings (e.g., `## Heading`) — not underline style
- Use fenced code blocks with language hints (e.g., ` ```bash `)
- Keep lines under 120 characters where practical
- Use `-` for unordered lists (not `*`)
- Use `**bold**` for check names and `—` (em-dash) before descriptions
- One blank line before and after headings, code blocks, and horizontal rules
- Checklist items follow the pattern: `- [ ] **Name** — Description`
